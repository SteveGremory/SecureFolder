# Zap

Compress and/or encrypt folders fast. Like, really fast.

## Usage:

First, as there aren't any pre-compiled binaries available, you'll have to compile the program using the rust toolchain, like so:

`cargo build --release`

_Side note: Be sure to build in release mode, otherwise it'll be quite slow._
